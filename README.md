# Assembly

MIPS and ASM coding for computer organization

Lab 1: Takes in three integer values from user input, multiplies them by three and adds the product together

Lab2 Part 1: Assumes values for the variables w, x, y, and z respectively. Program reads values (of type integer) from the console into the variables.

If [ (x â€“ y) >= w] then

Set x to y

Else:

Set x to z

Endif

Print x

Part 2 :  A program to swap the contents of two registers. Assuming there is only one additional register available that may be destroyed. Program initially reads values (of type integer, float is commented out, string is its own file) into registers. Next, it will swap the values read, then print the final contents of each register.
